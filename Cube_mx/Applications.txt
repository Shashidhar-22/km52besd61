STRUCTURES:

In STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) Cube programming, structures are extensively used for configuring and managing various settings related to the microcontroller peripherals.
Structures help organize and encapsulate the configuration parameters, making the code modular, readable, and easily maintainable.

In STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) Cube programming, structures are extensively used for configuring and managing various settings related to the microcontroller peripherals.
Structures help organize and encapsulate the configuration parameters, making the code modular, readable, and easily maintainable.

EXAMPLE 1:

* Initializes the RCC Oscillators according to the specified parameters in the RCC_OscInitTypeDef structure*

RCC_OscInitStruct.OscillatorType = RCC_OSCILLATORTYPE_HSI;
RCC_OscInitStruct.HSIState = RCC_HSI_ON;
RCC_OscInitStruct.HSICalibrationValue = RCC_HSICALIBRATION_DEFAULT;
RCC_OscInitStruct.PLL.PLLState = RCC_PLL_NONE;


EXAMPLE 2:
Configure the global features of the ADC (Clock, Resolution, Data Alignment and number of conversion)*/

hadc1.Instance = ADC1;
hadc1.Init.ClockPrescaler = ADC_CLOCK_SYNC_PCLK_DIV2;
hadc1.Init.Resolution = ADC_RESOLUTION_12B;
hadc1.Init.ScanConvMode = DISABLE;
hadc1.Init.ContinuousConvMode = DISABLE;
hadc1.Init.DiscontinuousConvMode = DISABLE;
hadc1.Init.ExternalTrigConvEdge = ADC_EXTERNALTRIGCONVEDGE_NONE;
hadc1.Init.ExternalTrigConv = ADC_SOFTWARE_START;
hadc1.Init.DataAlign = ADC_DATAALIGN_RIGHT;
hadc1.Init.NbrOfConversion = 1;
hadc1.Init.DMAContinuousRequests = DISABLE;
hadc1.Init.EOCSelection = ADC_EOC_SINGLE_CONV;


VOLATILE:

In STM32 HAL programming, when reading the temperature value from the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), the volatile keyword is often used to declare the variable that holds the ADC result.
This is particularly important when the variable is accessed both in the main program and in an interrupt service routine (ISR), ensuring that the compiler does not optimize away certain reads or writes that are essential for correct behavior in an embedded system.

EXAMPLE:
#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"

volatile uint32_t adcTemperatureValue = 0;

void HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback(ADC_HandleTypeDef* hadc) {
	// ADC conversion complete callback
	if (hadc->Instance == ADC1) {
		// Read the temperature value from ADC
		adcTemperatureValue = HAL_ADC_GetValue(hadc);
	}
}
int main(void) {
	HAL_Init();
	// Initialize ADC and other peripherals

	HAL_ADC_Start_IT(&hadc1); // Start ADC conversion with interrupt

	while (1) {
		// Main program code
		// Access adcTemperatureValue
	}
}

1.The adcTemperatureValue is declared as volatile, indicating that it may be modified asynchronously (e.g., in an ISR).
2.The ADC is configured to run in interrupt mode (HAL_ADC_Start_IT), and the ADC complete conversion callback (HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback) is triggered when the conversion is complete.
3.In the callback function, HAL_ADC_GetValue is used to read the ADC result, and the result is stored in the adcTemperatureValue variable.
4.The adcTemperatureValue variable is used in the main program.


ARRAY_OF_CHARACTER_POINTER:

The use of an array of character pointers (strings) is common when working with text-based data.Here's an example demonstrating the use of an array of character pointers in the context of USART (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) to store the wifi Commands.and accessed through index whenever the particular command is Required.

EXAMPLE:

const unsigned char a1[][50]={"AT\r\n","AT+RST\r\n","AT+CWMODE=3\r\n","AT+CWJAP=\"KM-2.4G4F\",\"9963111084\"\r\n","AT+CIFSR\r\n","AT+CIPMUX=0\r\n","AT+CWLAP\r\n","AT+CIPMODE=0\r\n"};
const unsigned char a2[][50]={"AT+CIPSTATUS\r\n","AT+CIPSTART=\"TCP\",\"142.93.218.33\",80\r\n","AT+CIPSEND=38\r\n","GET /page.php?temp=23&hum=1&dev=07\r\n\r\n","AT+CIPCLOSE\r\n"};

//Accessing through index to check CIPSTATUS

HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart6,a2[0],strlen(a2[0]),20);


DMA


In STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) programming, DMA is often used to enhance the performance of data transfer operations.

EXAMPLE:

Here's a simple example of configuring DMA for ADC data transfer:

#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"

DMA_HandleTypeDef hdma_adc;

void MX_DMA_Init(void)
{
	__HAL_RCC_DMA2_CLK_ENABLE();

	hdma_adc.Instance = DMA2_Stream0;
	hdma_adc.Init.Channel = DMA_CHANNEL_0;
	hdma_adc.Init.Direction = DMA_PERIPH_TO_MEMORY;
	hdma_adc.Init.PeriphInc = DMA_PINC_DISABLE;
	hdma_adc.Init.MemInc = DMA_MINC_ENABLE;
	hdma_adc.Init.PeriphDataAlignment = DMA_PDATAALIGN_WORD;
	hdma_adc.Init.MemDataAlignment = DMA_MDATAALIGN_WORD;
	hdma_adc.Init.Mode = DMA_CIRCULAR;
	hdma_adc.Init.Priority = DMA_PRIORITY_HIGH;
	hdma_adc.Init.FIFOMode = DMA_FIFOMODE_DISABLE;
	if (HAL_DMA_Init(&hdma_adc) != HAL_OK)
	{
		Error_Handler();
	}

	__HAL_LINKDMA(&hadc1, DMA_Handle, hdma_adc);

	HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(DMA2_Stream0_IRQn, 0, 0);
	HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ(DMA2_Stream0_IRQn);
}

This example initializes DMA for ADC data transfer in circular mode. The DMA controller is configured to move data from the ADC peripheral to memory with a circular buffer.

MACROS:

In STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) programming, macros are often used for various purposes to enhance code readability, maintainability, and flexibility.

>>  Pin Configuration 
Macros are commonly used to define GPIO pin configurations. This is particularly useful when configuring pins for different modes (input, output, alternate function, etc.).

// GPIO Pin Configuration Macros
#define LED_PIN     GPIO_PIN_13
#define LED_PORT    GPIOA


>> Configuration and Initialization

Macros are often used to define configuration parameters for peripherals during initialization. For example, you might use macros to set the baud rate, data format, and other configuration options for UART initialization.

// UART Configuration Macros
#define UART_BAUDRATE    9600
#define UART_DATA_FORMAT UART_WORDLENGTH_8B | UART_STOPBITS_1 | UART_PARITY_NONE



CONDITIONAL COMPILATION:

When working with different STM32 microcontroller variants or families, use conditional compilation to include platform-specific code. This helps create a codebase that can be easily adapted to different hardware configurations.

EXAMPLE:

#define STM32F4xx

#ifdef STM32F4xx
// Include code specific to STM32F4xx
#endif
