System Tick Timer Lab Assignments


1) Toggle PB13 (RED LED) every 100 msec delay using SysTick timer using 16 MHZ system clock source.
     And also test minimum and maximum delays of 16MHZ timer.
Draw flowcharts and write an embedded C program for the below 2 methods
a: polling method
b. interrupt method

2) Write a program to implement generic delay functions using Sys Tick timer with polling method.
void KM_mdelay(int );  
void KM_udelay(int );  
  
GPIO Project:

Draw Block Diagram and Write an embedded C program to display "Kernel Masters" on a monochrome LCD display using systemTIck timer delay instead of software delay?
