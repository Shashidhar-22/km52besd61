SPI Lab Assignments:
Experiment 1:
Write a pseudo code and Embedded C program to SPI1 Configuration using the below conditions,
And transmit character ‘A’ and Receive same character using hardware Loop back.
a. Full duplex comm.
b. Motorola Frame format
c. Enable Polling (nothing but disable SPI Interrupts)
Short PA6 & PA7 pins

PA4 - SPI1_NSS
PA5 - SPI1_SCK
PA6 - SPI1_MISO
PA7 - SPI1_MOSI

Experiment 2:  Above lab experiment with SPI Rx Interrupt. 

Experiment 3: Develop Communication between two Raayn MIni Boards using SPI protocol same as previous lab experiment using UART?
